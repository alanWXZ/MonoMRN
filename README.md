## 🧠 Overview

**Monocular Semantic Scene Completion (MSSC)** aims to infer voxel-wise occupancy and semantic labels from a **single RGB image**. Existing methods typically rely on **single-stage pipelines** that jointly handle visible segmentation and occluded region hallucination. However, these methods often suffer from **depth estimation errors** and limited generalizability to complex scenes.

**MonoMRN** is a novel **two-stage framework** designed to address these challenges:

1. **Stage 1: Coarse MSSC**
2. **Stage 2: Masked Recurrent Network (MRN)**  
   ‣ Focuses on refining occluded regions  
   ‣ Designs a **Masked Sparse Gated Recurrent Unit (MS-GRU)** to focus on occupied regions  
   ‣ Proposes a **Distance Attention Projection** to reduce projection errors
